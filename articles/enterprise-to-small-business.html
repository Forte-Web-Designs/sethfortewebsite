                <h1>What Building Enterprise Systems Taught Me</h1>
            </div>

        <section class="article-body">
            <div class="container">
                <p>I partner with Wells Fargo building systems that serve millions of customers. Then I build automation for small businesses with Forte Web Designs.</p>

                <p>Completely different scales. But the lessons transfer.</p>

                <p>Here's what working on enterprise systems taught me that makes me better at small business automation.</p>

                <p><strong>Plan for failure. Because everything fails eventually.</strong></p>

                <p>At enterprise scale, you can't assume anything will work perfectly. APIs go down. Databases get overloaded. Network connections drop. External services fail.</p>

                <p>So you build with failure in mind. Error handling. Retries. Fallbacks. Graceful degradation. Logging.</p>

                <p>Small business automation needs the same thinking. Maybe not the same complexity. But the same mindset.</p>

                <p>I built an automation for a client that pulled data from their e-commerce platform. Worked perfectly during testing. Deployed it. Worked great for two weeks. Then the e-commerce platform changed their API without warning. Automation broke.</p>

                <p>Client was frustrated. "Why didn't you plan for this?"</p>

                <p>Fair point. I should have. At Wells Fargo, we'd have error notifications. Fallback behavior. Automatic alerts when something breaks.</p>

                <p>Now I build that into small business projects too. Costs a bit more upfront. Saves massive headaches later.</p>

                <p><strong>Logging isn't optional. It's mandatory.</strong></p>

                <p>Enterprise systems log everything. Every transaction. Every error. Every state change. Not because we're paranoid. Because when something breaks, you need to know what happened.</p>

                <p>Small businesses rarely think about logging. They just want the automation to work. But when it doesn't work, they have no visibility into why.</p>

                <p>I had a client's automation mysteriously stop processing orders. No obvious errors. Just stopped working.</p>

                <p>Checked the logs. Turned out their vendor changed how they formatted order confirmations. One field was now optional instead of required. Automation expected that field. Didn't find it. Failed silently.</p>

                <p>Without logs, that would have taken days to diagnose. With logs, took 10 minutes.</p>

                <p>Now every automation I build includes logging. Doesn't need to be fancy. Just needs to record what happened, when, and whether it succeeded.</p>

                <p><strong>Security matters even when you're small.</strong></p>

                <p>At Wells Fargo, security is obsessive. Every system is hardened. Every connection encrypted. Every access point authenticated. Compliance audits constantly.</p>

                <p>Small businesses think they're too small to worry about security. They're not.</p>

                <p>I worked with a small medical practice. Wanted to automate patient appointment reminders. Simple project. But it involved patient data. HIPAA applies regardless of business size.</p>

                <p>Had to think about encryption. Access controls. Data retention. Audit trails. All the enterprise security principles. Scaled down for their context but fundamentally the same.</p>

                <p>You don't need enterprise-grade security infrastructure. But you need enterprise security thinking. Encrypt sensitive data. Use proper authentication. Don't store things you don't need. Follow compliance requirements.</p>

                <p>Security bugs in small systems cause the same problems as security bugs in big systems. Just because you're small doesn't mean you're safe.</p>

                <p><strong>Documentation is for future you.</strong></p>

                <p>Enterprise systems are documented extensively. Not because we love writing docs. Because systems last years. People change teams. Someone needs to understand how things work.</p>

                <p>Small business automation projects rarely get documented. I'm guilty of this too. Build it. Deploy it. Move on. Seems fine.</p>

                <p>Until six months later when the client asks for a change. I open the code. Have no memory of why I did things that way. Wish past me had written a comment explaining the logic.</p>

                <p>Now I document as I build. Not lengthy explanations. Just enough so future me or future maintainers can understand the decisions.</p>

                <p>Why this approach instead of that one. What assumptions I made. What edge cases exist. What integrations are fragile.</p>

                <p>Takes an extra 15 minutes during development. Saves hours during maintenance.</p>

                <p><strong>Version control isn't just for big teams.</strong></p>

                <p>Everything at Wells Fargo is in version control. Git repositories. Commit history. Code reviews. Branches.</p>

                <p>Solo consultants often skip this. Code lives on their laptop. Or maybe Dropbox. No real version control.</p>

                <p>That's risky. What if you need to roll back a change? What if you want to try something experimental without breaking the working version? What if your laptop dies?</p>

                <p>I use Git for everything now. Even small projects. Even solo work. Commit frequently. Write decent commit messages. Push to a remote repository.</p>

                <p>Has saved me multiple times when I needed to revert changes or understand what worked before.</p>

                <p><strong>Testing catches problems before clients do.</strong></p>

                <p>Enterprise development includes extensive testing. Unit tests. Integration tests. End-to-end tests. Automated test suites running constantly.</p>

                <p>Small business projects rarely have formal testing. Too expensive. Too time-consuming. Just test manually and ship.</p>

                <p>I don't do full enterprise testing for small projects. But I do systematic manual testing. Every path. Every edge case I can think of. Every integration point.</p>

                <p>And I document the test cases. So when I make changes later, I can run through the same tests and verify nothing broke.</p>

                <p>Catches most bugs before they reach clients. Much cheaper to fix bugs before deployment than after.</p>

                <p><strong>Simplicity scales better than complexity.</strong></p>

                <p>This one surprised me. You'd think enterprise systems are necessarily complex. Some are. But the best enterprise systems are simple at their core.</p>

                <p>Clear architecture. Well-defined interfaces. Minimal dependencies. Simple logic.</p>

                <p>Complexity is a liability. Makes things harder to maintain. Harder to debug. Harder to modify. More likely to break.</p>

                <p>When I build automation for small businesses, I aim for the simplest solution that works. Not the cleverest. Not the most feature-rich. The simplest.</p>

                <p>Because simple systems are reliable. Easy to understand. Easy to fix when they break. Easy to extend when requirements change.</p>

                <p>I've seen small business automation projects that are over-engineered. Someone built a complex system because they could. Not because they needed to.</p>

                <p>Those systems are nightmares to maintain. Every change risks breaking something. Every bug takes forever to diagnose.</p>

                <p>Simple wins. Every time.</p>

                <p><strong>The lessons that matter work at any scale.</strong></p>

                <p>You don't need enterprise infrastructure for small business automation. Don't need the same tools. Don't need the same budget.</p>

                <p>But you need the same principles. Plan for failure. Log everything important. Think about security. Document decisions. Use version control. Test systematically. Keep it simple.</p>

                <p>These aren't enterprise principles. They're good engineering principles. They apply whether you're building for millions of users or one small business.</p>

                <p>Working at Wells Fargo taught me that. Makes me a better consultant. Better engineer. Better problem solver.</p>

                <p>That's why I'm keeping the day job.</p>
