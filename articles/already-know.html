                <h1>You Already Know What To Do (You're Just Not Doing It)</h1>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Article Body -->
        <section class="article-body">
            <div class="container">
                <p>Let me ask you something.</p>

                <p>If I told you exactly what to do to fix your biggest problem right now, would you actually do it?</p>

                <p>Probably not.</p>

                <p>And I'm not saying that to be a jerk. I'm saying it because I do the same thing.</p>

                <p>Here's what I mean.</p>

                <h2>You Don't Have An Information Problem</h2>

                <p>I can tell you exactly how to change your life right now.</p>

                <p>Put your phone down. Get a piece of paper. Write down the three things you actually want. Every morning, ask yourself what you're doing today to get closer to those things. Every evening, check if you did it.</p>

                <p>That's it. Do that for six months and your life will be different.</p>

                <p>You're not going to do it though.</p>

                <p>Not because it's complicated. Not because you don't understand it. Because doing it is uncomfortable and not doing it is easy.</p>

                <p>I've told this to probably 20 clients over the last year. Maybe three of them actually did it consistently.</p>

                <p>The rest nodded, said "that makes sense," then went back to doing exactly what they were doing before.</p>

                <h2>I Do This Too</h2>

                <p>I know exactly what would grow my business faster.</p>

                <p>Write more blog posts. Do more outreach. Talk to more potential clients. Build case studies from successful projects.</p>

                <p>That's not complicated. I could start today.</p>

                <p>But most days I don't. I work on client projects, which is important. But I also spend an hour scrolling Twitter looking at what other consultants are doing. I reorganize my task management system. I research new automation tools I don't need.</p>

                <p>None of that grows my business. I know that. I do it anyway.</p>

                <p>Because writing blog posts is hard. Outreach is uncomfortable. Talking to potential clients means risking rejection.</p>

                <p>Scrolling Twitter feels like work but it's not actually work.</p>

                <h2>The Gap Between Knowing And Doing</h2>

                <p>This is the actual problem most people have.</p>

                <p>Not that they don't know what to do. They know exactly what to do. They're just not doing it.</p>

                <p>I had a client who wanted to automate their scheduling process. We had a discovery call. I told them exactly what they needed: a simple booking system connected to their calendar with automated confirmation emails.</p>

                <p>Cost would be about $2,000 to set up. Would save them about 8 hours a week.</p>

                <p>They said they'd think about it.</p>

                <p>Six months later, they're still manually scheduling everything. Still spending 8 hours a week on it. Still complaining about it.</p>

                <p>They know the solution. They're just not implementing it.</p>

                <p>Why? Because implementing it means making a decision, spending money, learning a new system, trusting that it'll work.</p>

                <p>Not implementing it means everything stays the same. Which is comfortable even when it sucks.</p>

                <h2>Action Is The Only Thing That Matters</h2>

                <p>Here's what actually creates change.</p>

                <p>Not knowing more. Not planning better. Not waiting for the perfect moment.</p>

                <p>Doing the thing.</p>

                <p>I spent three years "planning" to start a consulting business. Reading books about consulting. Taking courses. Building the perfect website. Creating service packages.</p>

                <p>None of that mattered until I actually reached out to my first potential client.</p>

                <p>That one action, which took about 10 minutes, did more for my business than three years of preparation.</p>

                <p>The preparation made me feel productive. The action actually created results.</p>

                <h2>What This Looks Like</h2>

                <p>You want to know if something will work?</p>

                <p>Try it for 30 days. Not research it. Not plan it. Actually do it.</p>

                <p>Write down three things you want. Every morning, decide what you're doing that day to get closer to one of them. Every evening, check if you did it.</p>

                <p>That's it.</p>

                <p>Not "write down three things and create a vision board and define your core values and map out a 5-year plan."</p>

                <p>Just three things. What you're doing today. Did you do it.</p>

                <p>Most people won't even try this. They'll read it, think "that's too simple," and go look for more complicated advice.</p>

                <p>The people who actually do it for 30 days? Their life looks different after those 30 days.</p>

                <p>Not because the system is magic. Because they spent 30 days taking action instead of thinking about taking action.</p>

                <h2>You're Probably Still Not Going To Do It</h2>

                <p>I can already hear the objections.</p>

                <p>"But what if I pick the wrong three things?"<br>
                "What if I don't know what I want?"<br>
                "What if I fail?"<br>
                "I'll start Monday."</p>

                <p>All of those are just reasons to not start.</p>

                <p>Pick three things. Any three things. If they're wrong, you'll figure that out and pick different things. That's still better than not picking anything.</p>

                <p>Don't know what you want? Pick three things that seem interesting and see what happens.</p>

                <p>Might fail? Definitely might fail. Do it anyway.</p>

                <p>Starting Monday? Why not start now?</p>

                <h2>The Part That's Actually Hard</h2>

                <p>Look, I get it.</p>

                <p>Taking action is scary. It means you might be wrong. It means you might waste time. It means you might look stupid.</p>

                <p>Not taking action means you stay safe. Nothing changes, but nothing goes wrong either.</p>

                <p>Except that's not actually true.</p>

                <p>Not taking action means a year from now you're in the exact same place complaining about the exact same problems.</p>

                <p>Taking action means a year from now you're somewhere different. Maybe better, maybe not, but at least different.</p>

                <p>I'd rather try something and have it not work than spend another year thinking about trying it.</p>

                <p>Most people would rather think about it.</p>

                <p>That's fine. But don't pretend you don't know what to do. You know. You're just not doing it.</p>

                <h2>So Are You Going To Do It?</h2>

                <p>Here's the test.</p>

                <p>After you finish reading this, are you going to put your phone down, get a piece of paper, and write down three things you want?</p>

                <p>Are you going to ask yourself tomorrow morning what you're doing today to get closer to one of them?</p>

                <p>Are you going to check tomorrow night if you did it?</p>

                <p>Probably not.</p>

                <p>But if you do, your life will start changing.</p>

                <p>Not because this is some magic system. Because you'll be taking action instead of just thinking about taking action.</p>

                <p>The gap between where you are and where you want to be isn't knowledge.</p>

                <p>It's action.</p>

                <p>You already know that though.</p>
