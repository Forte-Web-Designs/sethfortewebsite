        <section class="article-body">
            <div class="container">
                <p>Last post I explained what a bubble actually is. Companies burning cash, trying to outlast each other, hoping to be the last one standing.</p>

                <p>Now let's talk about what happens when one pops.</p>

                <p>Because we've seen this before. And it wasn't pretty.</p>

                <h2>The Dot-Com Bubble</h2>

                <p>Late 90s to early 2000s. Everyone was throwing money at anything with a ".com" in the name.</p>

                <p>Pets.com spent millions on Super Bowl ads before they had a sustainable business model. Webvan raised $800 million to deliver groceries and burned through it in two years.</p>

                <p>Investors were betting on potential, not profitability.</p>

                <p>Sound familiar?</p>

                <h2>When Reality Caught Up</h2>

                <p>The Nasdaq dropped from 5,000 to 1,300. That's an 80% decline in market value.</p>

                <p>But here's what people forget. It didn't happen overnight. It took about two years.</p>

                <p>Companies kept failing. Running out of cash. Getting acquired for pennies on the dollar or just disappearing entirely.</p>

                <p>It turned into $5 to $7 trillion in value. Gone.</p>

                <p>60% of dot-com companies shut down entirely. 200,000 people laid off. Venture funding collapsed from $105 billion to $20 billion.</p>

                <h2>The Part Everyone Misses</h2>

                <p>The technology didn't disappear.</p>

                <p>The internet didn't go away. It just turned out most companies building on it couldn't figure out how to make money.</p>

                <p>Google, founded in 1998, survived. Now "Google" is a verb.</p>

                <p>Amazon, founded in 1994, kept losing money for years. Everyone laughed at their quarterly reports. Now they dominate online retail.</p>

                <p>eBay became synonymous with online auctions.</p>

                <p>The bubble burst. Most companies failed. But the survivors who outlasted the chaos became the market leaders we know today.</p>

                <h2>The Pattern Is Always The Same</h2>

                <p>Bubble forms. Massive investment floods in. Too many competitors chasing the same opportunity.</p>

                <p>Bubble pops. Cash runs out. Most companies fail.</p>

                <p>The survivors consolidate the market and own it for the next decade.</p>

                <p>That's what happened with the internet. That's what's happening with streaming right now. That's what's coming for AI.</p>

                <h2>Why This Time Feels Different (But Isn't)</h2>

                <p>I hear people say "AI is different because the technology actually works."</p>

                <p>The internet actually worked too. E-commerce was real. Online services were valuable.</p>

                <p>That didn't stop 60% of companies from failing when the money ran out.</p>

                <p>The technology working doesn't mean the business model works. Those are two different things.</p>

                <p>OpenAI has incredible technology. But they're losing money on every API call. That's not sustainable regardless of how good the models are.</p>

                <h2>What This Means For AI</h2>

                <p>The same consolidation is coming.</p>

                <p>Right now there are dozens of AI companies. Most of them are burning investor cash, subsidizing usage, hoping to outlast each other.</p>

                <p>When the bubble pops, most will fail. A few will survive and own the market.</p>

                <p>The question is which ones. And what happens to all the businesses and developers who built on the platforms that don't make it.</p>

                <h2>The Timeline</h2>

                <p>With dot-com, it took about two years from peak to bottom.</p>

                <p>With AI, we're probably early in that cycle. The money is still flowing. Companies are still raising massive rounds. Usage is still growing.</p>

                <p>But the math doesn't work. At some point, it has to.</p>

                <p>The companies with the deepest pockets will survive longest. Microsoft backing OpenAI. Google with Gemini. Meta with Llama.</p>

                <p>The smaller players? They're on borrowed time.</p>

                <h2>What I'm Watching For</h2>

                <p>The first sign will be slower funding rounds. When VCs stop writing checks as easily, that's when the pressure starts.</p>

                <p>Then you'll see companies trying to raise prices. Testing whether users will pay enough to cover actual costs.</p>

                <p>Then layoffs. Cost cutting. Pivots. Acquisitions.</p>

                <p>It won't be one dramatic crash. It'll be a slow grind as reality catches up with expectations.</p>

                <p>That's what happened with dot-com. That's what's happening with streaming. That's what's coming for AI.</p>

                <p><strong>Next up in Part 3:</strong> The AI bubble by the numbers. And the math is ugly.</p>
