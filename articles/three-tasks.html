                <p>Not everything needs automation. Some tasks are better done by humans.</p>

                <p>But there are three types of work that are almost always worth automating.</p>

                <p><strong>First. Repetitive tasks you do the exact same way every time.</strong></p>

                <p>Data entry. Sending the same emails. Copying information between systems. Updating spreadsheets. If the steps never change, automate it.</p>

                <p>I had a client spending two hours daily copying data from their CRM to their accounting software. Same fields every time. Same format. Zero variation. Perfect automation candidate. Built a workflow in 30 minutes. Saved them 500 hours per year.</p>

                <p>The key is zero variation. If the task requires judgment calls or changes based on context, leave it alone. But if it's the same steps every single time, automate it.</p>

                <p><strong>Second. High-volume work that happens constantly.</strong></p>

                <p>Doesn't matter if each instance is quick. If you do it 50 times a day, it adds up. Sending appointment reminders. Processing orders. Updating inventory. Creating invoices.</p>

                <p>A medical practice I worked with was sending appointment reminders manually. Each reminder took 30 seconds. Doesn't sound like much. But they had 200 appointments weekly. That's 100 minutes per week. 86 hours per year. Just sending reminders.</p>

                <p>We automated it. System sends reminders 24 hours before appointments. Confirms via text. Updates their calendar automatically. Zero manual work. Still running perfectly months later.</p>

                <p>High-volume tasks are deceptive. Each one seems small. But they compound. That's where hours disappear.</p>

                <p><strong>Third. Low-judgment decisions that don't need human intuition.</strong></p>

                <p>Routing leads to the right salesperson based on location. Categorizing expenses by department. Assigning support tickets to team members. Scheduling social media posts.</p>

                <p>These tasks need decisions but not complex ones. If this, then that. Simple logic. Perfect for automation.</p>

                <p>I worked with a law firm that was manually assigning cases to attorneys. Someone would read the case type and assign it based on specialization. Took 10 minutes per case. 40 cases per week. Nearly seven hours of someone's time.</p>

                <p>We automated it. System reads the case type. Checks attorney availability and specialization. Assigns automatically. Took two weeks to build. Saved 350+ hours annually.</p>

                <p>The decision doesn't need a human. It just needs consistent logic.</p>

                <p><strong>Now here's the important part.</strong> A task needs to hit all three categories to be a great automation candidate.</p>

                <p>Repetitive AND high-volume AND low-judgment. That's the sweet spot.</p>

                <p>If it only hits one or two, think carefully. Might not be worth automating. Might be worth fixing the process instead.</p>

                <p>For example. A task that's repetitive and low-judgment but only happens twice a month? Probably not worth automating. Just do it manually.</p>

                <p>A task that's high-volume and low-judgment but has variation in the steps? Fix the variation first. Standardize it. Then automate.</p>

                <p>A task that's repetitive and high-volume but requires judgment calls? Leave it with humans. Or at least keep humans in the loop.</p>

                <p>Most businesses have at least five tasks that hit all three categories. Those are your quick wins. Automate those first. Get the value. Build trust in automation. Then tackle the harder stuff.</p>

                <p>Don't try to automate everything at once. Start with the obvious candidates. Prove it works. Then expand.</p>

                <p>The technical part is easy. The hard part is picking the right things to automate.</p>

                <p>Focus on repetitive, high-volume, low-judgment tasks. That's where automation pays for itself fastest.</p>
