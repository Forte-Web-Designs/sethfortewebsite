        <!-- Article Body -->
        <section class="article-body">
            <div class="container">
                <p>So far we've talked about the unsustainable economics, circular money, and the AGI gamble.</p>

                <p>There's another threat to the mega models that nobody's talking about. It's the threat from below.</p>

                <p>While OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google burn billions building massive general-purpose models, something sneaky is happening.</p>

                <p>Small, cheap, local models are starting to eat the market from the bottom.</p>

                <h2>Here's A Real Example</h2>

                <p>Austin, Texas is using an on-premise AI system for residential permits.</p>

                <p>They aren't using GPT-5 or Claude. They're using a local model running on their own servers.</p>

                <p>It's smaller. It's less capable overall. But it does the thing they care about very well.</p>

                <p>And it's financially sustainable.</p>

                <p>All they're paying is compute costs. No API fees. No subscriptions. No dependency on a company that might 10x their prices next year.</p>

                <h2>The 95% Failure Rate</h2>

                <p>Remember that MIT study? 95% of AI pilot projects fail.</p>

                <p>Part of that failure is cost. Companies are trying to integrate these mega models into their workflows, and even at today's artificially low prices, the math doesn't work.</p>

                <p>But what if those same projects used cheap local models instead?</p>

                <p>Maybe some of those 95% would have succeeded.</p>

                <p>That's the mega-model dilemma.</p>

                <h2>The Impossible Position</h2>

                <p>OpenAI and others are stuck.</p>

                <p>Their models are expensive to build. Expensive to run. They're subsidizing usage now, but eventually prices have to go up.</p>

                <p>When that happens, companies will start asking: Do we really need GPT-5 for this? Or can a smaller model do the job?</p>

                <p>For a lot of use cases, the answer is going to be the smaller model.</p>

                <h2>I'm Seeing This With Clients</h2>

                <p>I've built automation systems for clients using both approaches.</p>

                <p>One client needed AI to process customer inquiries. We tested GPT-4. It worked great. It was also expensive at scale.</p>

                <p>We tested a smaller local model fine-tuned for their specific use case. It worked almost as well. Cost was a fraction.</p>

                <p>They went with the local model.</p>

                <p>That's happening more and more. The mega models are impressive. But impressive doesn't always mean practical.</p>

                <h2>The Market Is Splitting</h2>

                <p>Mega models are at the top. Chasing AGI. Burning cash. Hoping for a breakthrough.</p>

                <p>Cheap focused models are at the bottom. Solving real problems at sustainable costs.</p>

                <p>And the bottom is growing faster.</p>

                <p>Every month, new local models get released. Llama. Mistral. Smaller versions that run on consumer hardware.</p>

                <p>They're not as capable as GPT-4 or Claude. But they're good enough for specific tasks. And good enough at 1/10th the cost is a compelling value proposition.</p>

                <h2>The Threat To OpenAI</h2>

                <p>The threat to OpenAI isn't only running out of money.</p>

                <p>It's becoming irrelevant for most practical use cases while they chase a moving target that might never arrive.</p>

                <p>If AGI doesn't come, and local models keep getting better at specific tasks, what's the value proposition for expensive general-purpose models?</p>

                <p>You're paying premium prices for capabilities you don't need.</p>

                <h2>What This Looks Like In Practice</h2>

                <p>Small businesses don't need GPT-5. They need something that automates their invoicing or handles basic customer service.</p>

                <p>Local governments don't need AGI. They need systems that process permits or answer citizen questions.</p>

                <p>Most companies don't need a model that can do everything. They need a model that does their specific thing really well.</p>

                <p>That's what local models are becoming. Specialized tools for specific jobs at sustainable prices.</p>

                <h2>The Inconvenient Truth</h2>

                <p>OpenAI's entire business model depends on general-purpose models being so much better than specialized models that the price premium is worth it.</p>

                <p>But as local models improve, that gap narrows.</p>

                <p>And when the gap is small enough, most companies will choose the cheaper option.</p>

                <p>Not because it's better. Because it's good enough.</p>

                <h2>What I'm Doing</h2>

                <p>I'm building with both.</p>

                <p>For complex, variable tasks that require real flexibility, I use Claude or GPT-4.</p>

                <p>For repetitive, well-defined tasks that don't change much, I'm increasingly using local models.</p>

                <p>That's the practical approach. Use the right tool for the job, not the most expensive tool for everything.</p>

                <p>And honestly? Most business automation falls into the second category. Repetitive, well-defined tasks.</p>

                <p>That's local model territory. And it's getting bigger.</p>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

                <p>The mega models aren't going away. They're useful for certain things.</p>

                <p>But the assumption that everyone needs them for everything? That's looking shakier every month.</p>

                <p>The threat from below is real. And it's growing while the mega models burn billions chasing a breakthrough that might not come.</p>

                <p><strong>Next up in Part 6:</strong> What happens when the bubble pops. The loud pop versus the slow deflation. Neither are pretty.</p>
