                <p>I used to think I had ADHD.</p>

                <p>I'd sit down to work and within five minutes I was checking email, then Slack, then Twitter, then back to email. Every single time.</p>

                <p>Turns out I didn't have ADHD. I was just incredibly well-practiced at distraction.</p>

                <p>Nobody teaches you how to concentrate. They just tell you to do it. That's like telling someone to run a marathon without ever explaining how to train.</p>

                <h2>You're Practicing The Wrong Thing</h2>

                <p>Here's what actually happens.</p>

                <p>You sit down to work on something hard. Your brain goes "this is uncomfortable" and immediately suggests checking your phone. You check your phone. Your brain learns: when things are hard, we escape to the phone.</p>

                <p>You do this 50 times a day.</p>

                <p>That's not a focus problem. That's 50 focus training sessions where you practiced distraction instead.</p>

                <p>I watched this happen with a client who couldn't finish building out their automation system. Every time they hit a tricky part, they'd "take a quick break" to check messages. Three months later, still not done.</p>

                <p>The issue wasn't the difficulty of the work. They were training their brain that difficulty equals distraction time.</p>

                <h2>What Actually Helps</h2>

                <p>I'm going to be honest. Most concentration advice is garbage.</p>

                <p>"Just meditate" or "eat brain food" sounds nice but doesn't solve the actual problem. Which is that you've spent years training yourself to be distractible.</p>

                <p>You need to retrain. And that's boring and uncomfortable.</p>

                <p>Here's what worked for me.</p>

                <p><strong>Stop doing two things at once.</strong> I know you think you're good at multitasking. You're not. Nobody is. When you're in a meeting, be in the meeting. When you're writing an email, write the email. Every time you switch, you're practicing distraction.</p>

                <p>I started with something stupid simple. When I ate lunch, I just ate lunch. Didn't check my phone, didn't read articles, didn't watch videos. Just ate.</p>

                <p>It was harder than I expected. My brain kept trying to add something else to do.</p>

                <p>That's the point. You're retraining.</p>

                <p><strong>Notice when you drift.</strong> You're going to get distracted. That's fine. The skill isn't never getting distracted. It's catching yourself and coming back.</p>

                <p>I'll be writing a blog post and suddenly realize I've been scrolling Twitter for six minutes. I don't get mad about it. I just close Twitter and go back to writing.</p>

                <p>Do that 100 times and you get better at catching yourself faster.</p>

                <p><strong>Sit still for ten minutes.</strong> This one sounds dumb but it's brutal.</p>

                <p>Just sit. Don't meditate, don't breathe in any special way. Just sit and don't move.</p>

                <p>Your brain will come up with 47 reasons why you should stop. You'll need to check something. You'll remember something important. You'll get itchy.</p>

                <p>Don't move. Sit there.</p>

                <p>This isn't about relaxation. It's about practicing the skill of staying with something uncomfortable.</p>

                <p>I do this maybe twice a week. It still sucks. But I'm noticeably better at staying focused on hard tasks now.</p>

                <h2>The Part That Actually Makes A Difference</h2>

                <p>Look, eating better food helps. Your brain needs fuel. Cut down on processed garbage and you'll think clearer. That's real.</p>

                <p>Meditation helps too. Ten minutes of breathing exercises every day does something. I'm not great at it, but when I do it consistently, I notice.</p>

                <p>But neither of those things matter if you're still practicing distraction all day.</p>

                <p>The biggest change for me was simple. When I talk to someone, I actually listen instead of planning what I'm going to say next.</p>

                <p>When someone on my team is explaining a problem, I'm not checking notifications or thinking about other stuff. I'm there.</p>

                <p>After the conversation, I can remember what they said. Before, I'd be in a meeting and have no idea what we just decided.</p>

                <p>That's not a memory problem. That's an attention problem.</p>

                <h2>It Takes Longer Than You Want</h2>

                <p>I wish I could tell you this takes two weeks and you're fixed.</p>

                <p>It doesn't work like that.</p>

                <p>I've been actively working on this for about eight months. I'm better, but I still catch myself getting distracted constantly. I still check my phone too much. I still drift during conversations sometimes.</p>

                <p>The difference is I catch it faster now. And I come back quicker.</p>

                <p>That's progress.</p>

                <p>You've spent years training yourself to be distracted. It's going to take more than a meditation app to undo that.</p>

                <p>But if you actually practice focusing, the same way you accidentally practiced distraction, you'll get better.</p>

                <p>Start with one thing. When you eat, just eat. When you're in a conversation, actually be in the conversation.</p>

                <p>See how long you can go before your brain tries to escape to something easier.</p>

                <p>Then do it again tomorrow.</p>
