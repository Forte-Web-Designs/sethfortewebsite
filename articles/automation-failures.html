                <p>Everyone thinks automation fails because of bad code or wrong tools. That's almost never the problem.</p>

                <p>It fails because people automate broken processes.</p>

                <p>You can't fix a bad system by making it faster. I've seen companies spend $50K automating something that shouldn't exist in the first place.</p>

                <p><strong>Here's what actually happens.</strong></p>

                <p>Someone has a manual process that takes too long. Data entry. Invoice processing. Customer onboarding. Whatever it is, it's eating up hours every week.</p>

                <p>They decide to automate it. Makes sense, right?</p>

                <p>But they never ask if the process itself is good. They just ask how to make it run without humans.</p>

                <p>So they build automation around a process that was already broken. Now it's just broken faster.</p>

                <p><strong>The real work is figuring out what actually needs to be automated.</strong></p>

                <p>Before I write a single line of code, I spend time watching how people actually work. Not how they think they work. How they actually work.</p>

                <p>I ask why they do things certain ways. Usually the answer is "because that's how we've always done it" or "because the old system required it."</p>

                <p>That's when you know there's a problem.</p>

                <p>Half the time, the solution isn't automation. It's fixing the process first, then automating the good version.</p>

                <p><strong>Sometimes you don't need automation at all.</strong></p>

                <p>I had a client who wanted to automate their weekly reporting. They were spending 10 hours compiling data from five different systems.</p>

                <p>Turns out three of those reports were going to people who never read them. Two were duplicating information that already existed elsewhere.</p>

                <p>We didn't automate anything. We just stopped making reports nobody needed.</p>

                <p>Saved 10 hours. Cost nothing.</p>

                <p><strong>The technical part is easy.</strong></p>

                <p>Once you know what actually needs to happen, building the automation is straightforward. Connect this system to that one. When X happens, do Y. Run it on a schedule.</p>

                <p>That's not the hard part.</p>

                <p>The hard part is understanding the business well enough to know what's worth automating and what's worth leaving alone.</p>

                <p>Most consultants skip this step. They're too eager to start building. They want to show progress. Write code. Demo features.</p>

                <p>But if you automate the wrong thing, none of that matters.</p>

                <p><strong>So before you automate anything, ask these questions:</strong></p>

                <p>Does this process actually need to exist? Could we just stop doing it?</p>

                <p>Is the process itself good, or are we working around limitations that don't exist anymore?</p>

                <p>If we fixed the process first, would we still need automation?</p>

                <p>Is this repetitive enough and high-volume enough to justify the setup time?</p>

                <p>If you can't answer yes to the last question and at least think hard about the first three, don't automate it yet.</p>

                <p><strong>Fix the process. Then automate the good version.</strong></p>

                <p>That's how you build automation that actually works.</p>
