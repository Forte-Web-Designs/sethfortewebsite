        <section class="article-body">
            <div class="container">
                <p>There's always a new automation platform. A better AI model. More features. Shinier interface. Better marketing.</p>

                <p>I ignore most of them.</p>

                <p>Not because they're bad. Some are genuinely better. But better tools don't always lead to better results.</p>

                <p>Here's why I stick with simple, boring tools most of the time.</p>

                <p><strong>Simple tools are reliable.</strong></p>

                <p>The fanciest platforms have the most features. Which means the most complexity. Which means the most ways things can break.</p>

                <p>I built an automation using a cutting-edge no-code platform. Beautiful interface. Incredible features. Could do things I couldn't easily do elsewhere.</p>

                <p>Worked great for two weeks. Then the platform updated. Changed how one of their features worked. Broke my automation. Took me half a day to fix it.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, a simpler automation I built with basic tools kept running without issues. No updates to adapt to. No new features breaking old functionality. Just worked.</p>

                <p>Reliability beats features. Especially for business automation that needs to run continuously without babysitting.</p>

                <p><strong>Simple tools are faster to learn.</strong></p>

                <p>Advanced platforms have steep learning curves. Documentation. Video tutorials. Certification courses. Hours of learning before you can build anything useful.</p>

                <p>That's fine if you're using the tool full-time. But for consulting projects, I need to deliver value quickly. Can't spend a week learning a new platform for every project.</p>

                <p>Simple tools I can learn in an afternoon. Start delivering value immediately. Ship projects faster.</p>

                <p>Client doesn't care if I used the fanciest tool. They care if the automation works and was delivered on time.</p>

                <p><strong>Simple tools are easier to maintain.</strong></p>

                <p>When you build something complex with an advanced tool, only you understand it. Or you + anyone else who's invested time learning that specific platform.</p>

                <p>If the client wants to modify it later, they need someone with that specialized knowledge. If they hire someone else, that person needs to learn the tool.</p>

                <p>Simple tools are easier to hand off. More people know them. Documentation is straightforward. Changes are simpler.</p>

                <p>I built an automation using a popular no-code tool with drag-and-drop workflows. Looked impressive. But when the client wanted changes six months later, they struggled to find someone who knew that specific platform.</p>

                <p>Compare that to automations I built with simple scripts. Any developer can read them. Understand them. Modify them. No specialized training required.</p>

                <p><strong>Simple tools cost less.</strong></p>

                <p>Advanced platforms charge for advanced features. Monthly subscriptions. Usage fees. Enterprise pricing.</p>

                <p>For complex use cases, worth it. But most small business automation doesn't need complex features.</p>

                <p>Had a client using an enterprise automation platform. Paying $300 monthly. Their automation was basic. Data transfer between two systems. Could have done the same thing with a simple script and a free tier of a basic integration tool.</p>

                <p>Switched them. Saved $3,600 annually. Same functionality. Lower cost. Actually more reliable because simpler.</p>

                <p><strong>Simple tools force better design.</strong></p>

                <p>When you have limited tools, you have to think carefully about the solution. Can't just throw features at the problem. Have to design efficiently.</p>

                <p>That constraint often leads to better solutions. Simpler logic. Clearer processes. Less complexity.</p>

                <p>I've seen automation built with advanced platforms that are over-engineered. Used fancy features because they were available. Not because they were necessary.</p>

                <p>Those systems are nightmares. Hard to debug. Hard to modify. Hard to understand.</p>

                <p>Simple tools don't let you over-engineer. You build what's needed. Nothing more.</p>

                <p><strong>When fancy tools actually matter.</strong></p>

                <p>I'm not saying never use advanced tools. Sometimes they're the right choice.</p>

                <p>If you need specific advanced features that simple tools don't offer, use the advanced tool. If the client already uses a platform and wants everything in one place, work within that platform. If scale requires enterprise features, use enterprise tools.</p>

                <p>But most small business automation doesn't need any of that.</p>

                <p>They need data moved from Point A to Point B. Need reports generated automatically. Need orders routed correctly. Need reminders sent on schedule.</p>

                <p>Simple problems. Simple tools work fine.</p>

                <p><strong>My typical tool stack is boring.</strong></p>

                <p>Zapier or Make for basic integrations. Python scripts for custom logic. Simple databases for data storage. Basic APIs for system connections. Cron jobs for scheduling.</p>

                <p>Nothing cutting-edge. Nothing exciting. Tools that have existed for years. Well-documented. Well-understood. Proven.</p>

                <p>Could I use fancier tools? Sure. Would projects be more impressive-sounding? Maybe. Would they work better? Probably not.</p>

                <p><strong>The test: Can someone else fix it?</strong></p>

                <p>If I get hit by a bus tomorrow, can someone else maintain the automation I built?</p>

                <p>If I used some obscure advanced platform, probably not. They'd need to learn that platform first. Might be easier to rebuild from scratch.</p>

                <p>If I used simple, common tools, yes. Any decent developer can pick it up. Read the code or workflow. Understand what it does. Make changes.</p>

                <p>That's better for clients. Better for long-term maintainability. Better for everyone.</p>

                <p><strong>Technology changes fast. Fundamentals don't.</strong></p>

                <p>New tools come and go. Remember all the hot no-code platforms from five years ago that don't exist anymore? All the automation tools that pivoted or shut down?</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, Python still exists. APIs still work the same way. Databases still store data. HTTP requests still transfer information.</p>

                <p>Building on fundamentals means less risk of your tools disappearing. Less risk of vendor lock-in. Less risk of forced migrations when a platform pivots.</p>

                <p>Boring and stable beats exciting and risky.</p>

                <p><strong>Clients don't care about the tech stack.</strong></p>

                <p>I used to think clients wanted to hear about the advanced tools I used. Thought it made me sound more expert.</p>

                <p>They don't care. At all.</p>

                <p>They care if the automation works. If it saves them time. If it's reliable. If it's affordable. If it solves their problem.</p>

                <p>The tech stack is invisible to them. As it should be.</p>

                <p>So why optimize for fancy tools that don't matter to the client and make the work harder for me?</p>

                <p>Use the simplest tool that solves the problem. Ship it. Move on.</p>

                <p>That's my approach. Works well. Keeps things maintainable. Keeps costs down. Keeps reliability high.</p>

                <p>Boring wins.</p>
