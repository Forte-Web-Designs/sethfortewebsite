                <p>I used to hate sales calls. Felt pushy. Uncomfortable. Like I was trying to convince someone to buy something they didn't need.</p>

                <p>Turns out I was doing them wrong.</p>

                <p>Sales calls aren't about selling. They're about diagnosing. Figuring out if you can actually help. And being honest when you can't.</p>

                <p>Here's what changed when I stopped trying to close deals and started trying to solve problems.</p>

                <p><strong>I stopped pitching. Started asking questions.</strong></p>

                <p>Early discovery calls, I'd spend 20 minutes explaining what I do. All the services Forte Web Designs offers. All the technologies I use. All my experience.</p>

                <p>People would listen politely. Ask a few questions. Say they'd think about it. Never hear from them again.</p>

                <p>Because I was talking about me. Not about them. Not about their actual problems.</p>

                <p>Now I barely talk about myself. Ask questions instead. What's the problem? How are you handling it now? How much time does it take? What have you tried?</p>

                <p>Most of the call is them talking. Me listening. Taking notes. Understanding the situation.</p>

                <p>Only after I understand the problem do I talk about solutions. And by then, it's not a pitch. It's a diagnosis. "Here's what I think would work. Here's why. Here's what it would cost. Here's how long it would take."</p>

                <p>Much more honest. Much less awkward. Much higher close rate.</p>

                <p><strong>I tell people when I'm not the right fit.</strong></p>

                <p>This was the hardest change. Early on, every call felt like an opportunity I couldn't afford to lose. Even when I knew it wasn't a good fit, I'd try to make it work.</p>

                <p>Bad idea. Led to projects that struggled. Clients who weren't happy. Work I didn't enjoy.</p>

                <p>Now if it's not a good fit, I say so. Right on the call. "I don't think I'm the right person for this. Here's why. Here's what I'd recommend instead."</p>

                <p>Sometimes I refer them to someone else. Sometimes I suggest they solve it differently. Sometimes I tell them they're not ready for automation yet.</p>

                <p>You'd think this would hurt business. It doesn't. People appreciate honesty. They remember it. They refer others. Sometimes they come back later when they actually do need what I offer.</p>

                <p>And I avoid bad projects. Win-win.</p>

                <p><strong>I talk about money early.</strong></p>

                <p>Used to dance around pricing. Wait until the end. Try to build value first. Make them want it before discussing cost.</p>

                <p>Classic sales tactic. Doesn't work for consulting.</p>

                <p>Now I bring up budget in the first 15 minutes. "What's your budget for this?" Or "Projects like this typically cost $X to $Y. Does that align with what you're thinking?"</p>

                <p>If we're not in the same ballpark, better to know immediately. Saves everyone's time.</p>

                <p>Had a discovery call where the prospect wanted a complex automation. Multi-system integration. Custom workflows. AI-powered features. Estimated at least $15K.</p>

                <p>Asked their budget. "$2,000."</p>

                <p>Huge gap. Told them honestly. "What you're describing would cost significantly more than your budget. Here are some alternatives that might fit." Recommended some off-the-shelf tools they could try.</p>

                <p>They appreciated it. Might come back when they have bigger budget. But we didn't waste an hour discussing a project that was never going to happen.</p>

                <p><strong>I'm honest about timelines.</strong></p>

                <p>Clients always want things faster than realistic. "Can you have this done in two weeks?"</p>

                <p>Early on, I'd say yes. Try to make it work. Rush the process. Deliver something that technically worked but wasn't great.</p>

                <p>Now I'm honest. "Two weeks isn't realistic for this. Here's why. Here's what I could deliver in two weeks. Here's what would take six weeks but would actually solve your problem."</p>

                <p>Let them decide. Sometimes they have real urgency and we figure out a smaller first phase. Sometimes they realize they can wait for the proper solution.</p>

                <p>Either way, we start with realistic expectations. Much better than overpromising and underdelivering.</p>

                <p><strong>I don't pretend to know things I don't know.</strong></p>

                <p>Consultant instinct is to seem expert at everything. Never admit uncertainty. Always have an answer.</p>

                <p>That's exhausting and dishonest.</p>

                <p>Now if someone asks about a technology I haven't used, I say so. "I haven't worked with that specific platform. But I've worked with similar ones. I'd need to research that before giving you a definitive answer."</p>

                <p>Or if they describe a problem I'm not sure I can solve: "That's more complex than what I typically handle. I might not be the right person. Let me think about it and get back to you."</p>

                <p>People respect honesty. They'd rather work with someone who admits what they don't know than someone who pretends to know everything.</p>

                <p><strong>I actually listen to what they're saying.</strong></p>

                <p>Sounds obvious. But it's hard. While someone's talking, I'm often thinking about my response. Planning what to say next. Mentally drafting a solution.</p>

                <p>That means I miss things. Details that matter. Context that changes the solution.</p>

                <p>Now I force myself to just listen. Take notes. Let them finish. Pause before responding. Think about what they actually said, not what I expected them to say.</p>

                <p>Leads to better solutions. And makes people feel heard. Which matters more than people realize.</p>

                <p><strong>I end calls without a clear next step sometimes.</strong></p>

                <p>Classic sales advice: always close with a next step. Schedule a follow-up. Send a proposal. Get commitment.</p>

                <p>But sometimes the right next step is nothing. Or "think about it and let me know."</p>

                <p>Not every call needs to convert immediately. Some people need time. Some aren't ready. Some are just gathering information.</p>

                <p>I used to push for next steps even when it felt forced. Now I'm comfortable with ambiguity. "Take some time to think about whether this makes sense for you. Here's my email. Reach out if you want to move forward."</p>

                <p>Some never respond. That's fine. They weren't ready. Or decided on a different path. No hard feelings.</p>

                <p>Some respond weeks or months later. "Okay, we're ready. Let's do this." Those turn into great projects because they've had time to commit internally.</p>

                <p><strong>The best sales calls don't feel like sales calls.</strong></p>

                <p>They feel like conversations. Two people trying to figure out if there's a problem worth solving and whether I'm the right person to solve it.</p>

                <p>No pressure. No tactics. No games. Just honest dialogue.</p>

                <p>When I approach calls that way, they're not awkward anymore. They're actually enjoyable. I'm learning about interesting businesses and problems. Meeting smart people. Occasionally finding work that's a perfect fit.</p>

                <p>And when it's not a fit, that's okay too. Better to figure that out in 30 minutes than after signing a contract.</p>

                <p>Sales calls are still my least favorite part of consulting. But they're not painful anymore. Just part of the process. A diagnostic conversation before real work begins.</p>

                <p>And that I can do.</p>
