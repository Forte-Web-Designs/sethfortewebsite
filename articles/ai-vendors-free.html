                    <p class="article-date">Oct 25, 2025</p>
                </header>

                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>Zoho announced last week they're making their AI agents free across all their apps.</p>

                    <p>Not a free trial. Not a discount. Just free.</p>

                    <p>Microsoft is doing the same thing with free training courses and free Copilot access. Google Cloud has a free tier for AI agents. Freshworks, Intercom, Zendesk, HubSpot all rolling out free AI tools.</p>

                    <p>This isn't generosity. This is panic.</p>

                    <h2>Nobody Is Actually Using This Stuff</h2>

                    <p>Here's the number that matters.</p>

                    <p>Salesforce launched Agentforce earlier this year with massive fanfare. They have 150,000 customers.</p>

                    <p>12,000 of them signed up to use it.</p>

                    <p>That's 8%. Of customers who already use Salesforce and presumably trust them enough to pay for their software.</p>

                    <p>Eight percent bothered to try the AI agents.</p>

                    <p>That's not an adoption problem. That's a "the thing you're selling doesn't solve the problem you think it solves" problem.</p>

                    <p>And Salesforce isn't alone. Every AI vendor is dealing with the same gap between hype and actual usage.</p>

                    <p>So they're making it free. Because if cost is the barrier, removing cost should fix it, right?</p>

                    <p>Except cost isn't the barrier.</p>

                    <h2>The Real Problem</h2>

                    <p>I talk to businesses every week about automation and AI. Almost none of them are worried about the cost of the software.</p>

                    <p>They're worried about everything else.</p>

                    <p>Their data is a mess. It's in five different systems that don't talk to each other. Half of it is in spreadsheets. The other half is in people's heads.</p>

                    <p>AI agents need clean, structured, integrated data. Most businesses don't have that.</p>

                    <p>Their processes are broken. They want to automate customer service, but their customer service process itself doesn't make sense. Automating a broken process just makes it faster at being broken.</p>

                    <p>They don't know how to integrate this with their existing systems. Their tech stack is held together with duct tape and prayers. Adding AI agents means more integration work.</p>

                    <p>They don't have buy-in from their team. Employees see "AI agent" and think "they're replacing me." Unless you handle that carefully, you're fighting internal resistance the whole way.</p>

                    <p>Making the software free doesn't solve any of these problems.</p>

                    <h2>Why Vendors Are Doing This Anyway</h2>

                    <p>Here's what's actually happening.</p>

                    <p>AI vendors spent the last two years building agent platforms. They raised money. They hired teams. They made promises to investors.</p>

                    <p>Now they need adoption numbers to justify all of that.</p>

                    <p>But businesses aren't adopting. Not because the technology is bad. Because the gap between "cool demo" and "actually works in production" is huge.</p>

                    <p>So vendors are removing every barrier they can control. Price is easy to control. Make it free. Get people in the door. Hope they figure out the hard parts and stick around.</p>

                    <p>It's not a bad strategy. But it's also not solving the fundamental problem.</p>

                    <p>I've seen this with clients. They get excited about a free AI tool. They sign up. They spend two weeks trying to make it work with their existing systems. They realize their data isn't ready. They give up.</p>

                    <p>The tool didn't fail. The organization wasn't ready for the tool.</p>

                    <h2>The Adoption Gap Is Real</h2>

                    <p>UiPath did a survey. 90% of IT executives think AI agents could improve their business.</p>

                    <p>Only 37% actually use them.</p>

                    <p>That gap tells you everything. It's not that people don't see the value. It's that implementing the value is harder than expected.</p>

                    <p>Most companies are stuck in pilot mode. They test the AI agent on a small use case. It works okay in the test. Then they try to scale it to production and run into all the integration, data quality, and workflow problems.</p>

                    <p>So it stays in pilot mode forever.</p>

                    <p>Free access doesn't fix that. If anything, it might make it worse. Because now you have no financial commitment forcing you to actually do the hard work of implementation.</p>

                    <h2>What This Means If You're Considering AI</h2>

                    <p>If you're looking at AI agents for your business, here's what to know.</p>

                    <p>The fact that everything is free now is not a reason to jump in. It's a signal that vendors are desperate for adoption, which means the implementation challenges are bigger than the marketing suggests.</p>

                    <p>That doesn't mean you shouldn't use AI agents. It means you should be realistic about what it takes.</p>

                    <p>Before you sign up for any free AI tool, ask yourself:</p>

                    <p>Is your data actually ready? Can the AI access the information it needs? Is that information accurate and up to date?</p>

                    <p>Are your processes clear? Can you explain exactly how things should work? If you can't explain it to a person, you can't explain it to an AI.</p>

                    <p>Do you have the technical capacity to integrate this? Or are you going to get stuck trying to connect it to your existing systems?</p>

                    <p>Does your team understand what's changing? Have you addressed concerns about job security and workflow changes?</p>

                    <p>If the answer to any of those is no, free AI tools aren't going to help. You'll waste time trying to make them work and end up back where you started.</p>

                    <h2>The Companies That Will Win</h2>

                    <p>The shift to free AI tools is actually good news for businesses that are ready.</p>

                    <p>If you've done the work of cleaning up your data, documenting your processes, and getting organizational buy-in, you can now access really powerful tools for almost nothing.</p>

                    <p>That's a genuine advantage. You can test sophisticated AI agents without significant financial risk.</p>

                    <p>The companies that will struggle are the ones who think free means easy. They'll sign up, realize it's complicated, and bounce.</p>

                    <p>The companies that will win are the ones who understand that free software still requires organizational readiness.</p>

                    <p>I had a client last month who wanted to implement AI for customer support. Before we even looked at tools, we spent three weeks mapping their current support process, cleaning up their knowledge base, and training the team on what to expect.</p>

                    <p>Then we implemented the AI. It worked because we did the foundation work first.</p>

                    <p>If we'd just signed up for a free AI agent and hoped it would figure things out, it would have failed.</p>

                    <h2>What This Really Tells Us</h2>

                    <p>The rush to make AI free tells you where the market actually is.</p>

                    <p>We're not in the "everybody needs this now" phase. We're in the "we need to convince people this is worth the implementation effort" phase.</p>

                    <p>That's fine. That's normal for new technology. But it's different from what the marketing suggests.</p>

                    <p>If AI agents were clearly solving obvious problems with minimal implementation effort, vendors wouldn't need to make them free. They'd be selling as fast as they could build them.</p>

                    <p>The fact that they're free means the value proposition isn't clear enough yet. The implementation is too hard. The results are too uncertain.</p>

                    <p>That doesn't mean AI agents are bad. It means we're earlier in the adoption curve than the hype suggests.</p>

                    <p>For businesses, that's actually useful information. It means you have time to get ready. Clean up your data. Fix your processes. Build organizational readiness.</p>

                    <p>Then when you're ready, there are powerful free tools waiting for you.</p>

                    <p>Just don't mistake free for easy.</p>
