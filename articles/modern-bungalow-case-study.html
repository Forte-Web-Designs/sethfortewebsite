                    <p>A furniture company in Texas reached out last month with a problem that sounded simple.</p>

                    <p>They were spending 20 hours a week manually sending order update emails to customers. Someone would check Shopify, see an order moved to production, copy the customer email, write the update, send it.</p>

                    <p>For hundreds of orders every month.</p>

                    <p>They wanted it automated.</p>

                    <h2>What They Actually Needed</h2>

                    <p>Modern Bungalow sells custom furniture, lighting, and rugs. Made to order stuff that takes weeks to produce.</p>

                    <p>Their workflow: Order comes in. Goes into production queue. Moves to production. Gets completed. Ready for delivery.</p>

                    <p>At each stage, customers need an update. "Your order is in the queue." "Your furniture is in production." "It's complete and ready."</p>

                    <p>Different products need different messaging. Lighting emails are different from furniture emails. They have three delivery partners, each needs specific information in the delivery email.</p>

                    <p>All of this was being done manually. Every single email.</p>

                    <p>The automation seemed straightforward. Monitor Shopify orders. When status changes, send the appropriate email.</p>

                    <p>Except I made it more complicated than it needed to be.</p>

                    <h2>The Part I Got Wrong</h2>

                    <p>Here's what I didn't think through carefully enough.</p>

                    <p>The "order is queued" email was supposed to send 24 hours after an order was placed. That buffer gives them time to check inventory before telling the customer anything.</p>

                    <p>I built the logic so once that email sent, they had to manually clear a field before the next email would work.</p>

                    <p>That's an extra step. The whole point was eliminating manual steps.</p>

                    <p>Worse, if they forgot to clear it, the status emails wouldn't send at all. I'd built something that required the team to remember an arbitrary technical rule.</p>

                    <p>That's bad automation.</p>

                    <p>Three weeks after launch, I rebuilt the core logic. Now the queue check and status check are completely independent. They don't interfere with each other.</p>

                    <p>The team can leave fields alone. Just update the order status and everything happens automatically.</p>

                    <p>That's how it should have worked from the beginning.</p>

                    <h2>What Actually Worked</h2>

                    <p>The system monitors their Shopify orders every five minutes. When they update an order's status, the automation sends the right email within five minutes.</p>

                    <p>Nine different email templates:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Queue notification</li>
                        <li>In production (lighting, rugs, furniture - each different)</li>
                        <li>Production complete</li>
                        <li>Ready for delivery (different for each delivery partner)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Every email logs automatically to the order notes with a timestamp. Complete audit trail.</p>

                    <p>Zero manual work. Just update Shopify like they normally would.</p>

                    <h2>The Real Numbers</h2>

                    <p>They're saving 20+ hours a week. That's 80+ hours a month they're not spending on email management.</p>

                    <p>But the bigger impact is consistency. Before, customer communication depended on who was working and whether they remembered. Now every customer gets clear updates at the exact right time.</p>

                    <p>95% reduction in manual data entry. 100% order accuracy. Zero duplicate emails.</p>

                    <h2>What I'd Do Differently</h2>

                    <p>I should have spent more time upfront mapping the workflow before writing code.</p>

                    <p>I jumped into building too fast. Built the queue logic before fully thinking through how it would interact with status emails.</p>

                    <p>That's why I had to rebuild it three weeks later.</p>

                    <p>I should have drawn out the entire flow on paper first. Worked through every combination before writing a line of code.</p>

                    <p>The other mistake: not testing enough edge cases before launch. The system worked fine for the happy path. But what about when someone makes a mistake? What if an order skips a step?</p>

                    <p>I found those issues in production. Should have found them in testing.</p>

                    <h2>The Part That Took Time</h2>

                    <p>The technical build was maybe three days including testing.</p>

                    <p>Everything else took way longer.</p>

                    <p>Understanding their actual workflow. Mapping every scenario. Building email templates they were happy with. Writing 34 pages of documentation so they're not dependent on me.</p>

                    <p>That's where the work actually is. The code is the easy part.</p>

                    <p>The system saves them about $40K a year in labor costs. They paid me a fraction of that to build it.</p>

                    <p>That's what good automation does. Removes manual work, makes processes reliable, pays for itself in months.</p>
