                <p>Remember when Netflix was $8 a month and had everything?</p>

                <p>Now you need Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, HBO Max, Amazon Prime, and Paramount+ just to watch what used to be on cable. And half of them have ads now unless you pay even more.</p>

                <p>YouTube TV costs more than cable did.</p>

                <p>Uber was supposed to kill expensive taxis. Now it costs the same or more, and drivers make less.</p>

                <p>Airbnb promised affordable local experiences. Now it's more expensive than hotels with cleaning fees, service fees, and a 40-item checkout list.</p>

                <p>Every tech company from the 2010s followed the same playbook. Make something great. Price it low. Get everyone hooked. Then slowly make it worse while charging more.</p>

                <p>And I'm terrified the automation industry is heading the same direction.</p>

                <h2>The Pattern Everyone Followed</h2>

                <p>Here's what happened with every 2010s tech company.</p>

                <p>Phase 1: Make something genuinely better and cheaper. Netflix was actually better than cable. Uber was actually cheaper than taxis. Airbnb was actually more affordable than hotels.</p>

                <p>They weren't lying. The value was real.</p>

                <p>Phase 2: Grow at all costs. Raise venture capital. Undercut competitors. Lose money on every transaction but make it up in volume (or don't, just grow). Get everyone dependent on your platform.</p>

                <p>Phase 3: Extract. Once you have market dominance and everyone's hooked, start increasing prices. Add fees. Remove features. Make the experience worse while charging more.</p>

                <p>That's not a conspiracy theory. That's literally the business model. It's called "enshittification" and it's how most venture-backed tech companies operate.</p>

                <p>They call it "finding product-market fit" and "optimizing unit economics." What they mean is "we got you hooked, now we're raising prices."</p>

                <h2>Why I Think About This Constantly</h2>

                <p>I run an automation consulting business. My pitch is basically: "I can save you 20 hours a week and thousands of dollars a year by automating manual work."</p>

                <p>That's valuable. That's real. My clients see those results.</p>

                <p>But I'm watching the broader automation and AI industry, and I see the same pattern starting.</p>

                <p>AI tools that started free are adding paywalls. Automation platforms that were affordable are raising prices 40%. "AI consultants" are popping up everywhere promising to solve everything with ChatGPT.</p>

                <p>The gold rush phase. Where everyone's trying to grab market share and growth, not thinking about sustainable value.</p>

                <p>And I keep asking myself: how do I not become that?</p>

                <h2>The Temptation Is Real</h2>

                <p>Here's what I could do if I wanted to maximize short-term revenue.</p>

                <p>Overpromise. Tell every client AI will solve all their problems. Build hype about capabilities that don't exist yet. Get them signed up before they realize the limitations.</p>

                <p>Underbuild. Deliver the minimum viable solution. Get paid. Move to the next client. Don't worry about whether it actually works long-term.</p>

                <p>Create dependency. Build systems they can't modify themselves. Make them reliant on me for every change. Recurring revenue forever.</p>

                <p>Raise prices aggressively. Once they're dependent, increase prices. They're already invested, they'll pay.</p>

                <p>That's the playbook. And it works in the short term. You'd make a lot of money quickly.</p>

                <p>But you'd also be doing exactly what streaming services and rideshare companies did. Delivering real value initially, then extracting more while delivering less.</p>

                <h2>Why I'm Trying To Do The Opposite</h2>

                <p>I could charge way more than I do. I know what my competitors charge. I'm leaving money on the table.</p>

                <p>But I'm optimizing for something different.</p>

                <p>I want clients who come back. Not because they're locked in. Because the first thing I built actually worked and they trust me with the next thing.</p>

                <p>I want to build systems they can modify themselves. Not because I'm scared of losing recurring revenue. Because they should own what they pay for.</p>

                <p>I want to be honest about what AI can and can't do. Not because honesty is noble. Because overpromising destroys trust, and I need trust to do good work.</p>

                <p>I want sustainable pricing. Not "low to get you hooked then raise it later." Just fair pricing that reflects the value delivered.</p>

                <p>That's not altruism. That's self-interest aligned with client success.</p>

                <h2>What This Looks Like Practically</h2>

                <p>A potential client asked me last month to build an AI system to handle their customer service.</p>

                <p>I could have said yes, taken the money, built something that technically worked but didn't actually solve their problem.</p>

                <p>Instead I told them their customer service process was broken. AI would just make the broken process faster. They needed to fix the process first, then we could automate it.</p>

                <p>That conversation cost me a sale. They didn't want to hear that fixing their process would take work.</p>

                <p>But it was the honest answer. And lying to close a sale turns me into exactly what I'm trying not to become.</p>

                <p>I had another client who wanted ongoing support after a project. Wanted me on retainer to make changes and updates.</p>

                <p>I built the system in a way they could modify themselves. Walked them through how it worked. Gave them documentation. Told them to call me if they got stuck, but they probably wouldn't need to.</p>

                <p>That cost me recurring revenue. But they own their system. They're not dependent on me. They'll call me when they have the next automation opportunity because they trust I won't lock them in.</p>

                <p>That's the tradeoff. Less short-term revenue. More long-term relationships.</p>

                <h2>The Part That's Hard To Admit</h2>

                <p>I don't know if this model actually works long-term.</p>

                <p>Maybe I'm being naive. Maybe the extraction model wins because that's how capitalism works. Maybe being ethical about consulting is just leaving money on the table for no reason.</p>

                <p>I see other consultants charging 3x what I charge. Building dependency. Raising prices on existing clients. Making more money than me.</p>

                <p>Maybe they're right and I'm wrong.</p>

                <p>But I've watched what happened to tech companies that went the extraction route. They made a lot of money. They also created a lot of resentment.</p>

                <p>People hate their streaming subscriptions now. They hate rideshare prices. They hate Airbnb fees. They use them because they're stuck, not because they want to.</p>

                <p>That's not the relationship I want with clients.</p>

                <h2>What Ethical Automation Actually Looks Like</h2>

                <p>I think ethical automation consulting means a few specific things.</p>

                <p>Be honest about what AI can and can't do. Don't overpromise. Don't sell capabilities that don't exist yet. Don't pretend you can automate things that require human judgment.</p>

                <p>Build systems clients can own and modify. Don't create dependency. Make yourself optional, not essential.</p>

                <p>Charge fair prices that reflect value delivered. Not "as much as they'll pay" or "whatever the market will bear." Actual value-based pricing where the client wins too.</p>

                <p>Think long-term. Optimize for clients coming back because they want to, not because they're locked in.</p>

                <p>Be transparent about costs and tradeoffs. If something's going to be expensive to maintain, say so upfront. If there's a simpler solution that costs less, recommend that even if it means less revenue.</p>

                <p>This might sound idealistic. Maybe it is.</p>

                <p>But I've seen what happens when you optimize purely for extraction. You make money. You also build a business you eventually hate, working with clients who resent you.</p>

                <p>I'd rather build something sustainable.</p>

                <h2>The Test I'm Using</h2>

                <p>Here's my personal test for whether I'm heading the wrong direction.</p>

                <p>If a client from three years ago called me today, would they be happy to hear from me? Or would they think "oh great, what's he trying to sell me now?"</p>

                <p>If the answer is the second one, I've become what I'm trying not to become.</p>

                <p>So far, clients from years ago still refer people to me. Still call when they have new automation needs. Still say good things about working together.</p>

                <p>That tells me I'm probably on the right track.</p>

                <p>But I have to keep checking. Because the temptation to extract instead of deliver is always there.</p>

                <p>The tech companies from the 2010s didn't start out planning to enshittify their products. They just slowly optimized for growth and revenue until they got there.</p>

                <p>I'm trying not to make the same mistake.</p>

                <p>We'll see if it works.</p>
