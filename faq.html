                        <h3>What do you actually do?</h3>
                        <p>I help businesses stop wasting time on things that should be automatic.</p>
                        <p>That usually means one of these:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Automation</strong> - Connecting your tools so data flows without manual work</li>
                            <li><strong>CRM cleanup</strong> - Fixing your messy data so you can actually trust it</li>
                            <li><strong>Custom dashboards</strong> - Building views that show what matters, not what the software defaults to</li>
                            <li><strong>AI integration</strong> - Using AI for analysis, content, or pattern recognition at scale</li>
                            <li><strong>Web design</strong> - Building websites that work for you, not just look good</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Most projects combine a few of these. The goal is always the same: give you time back and make your systems actually work.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How much does this cost?</h3>
                        <p>It depends on the problem. Here's the honest range:</p>

                            <thead>

                            <tbody>
                                <tr><td>Single automation or integration</td><td>$2,500 - $5,000</td></tr>
                                <tr><td>CRM cleanup or data work</td><td>$3,000 - $12,000</td></tr>
                                <tr><td>Custom dashboard or internal tool</td><td>$4,000 - $15,000</td></tr>
                                <tr><td>AI analysis or content system</td><td>$5,000 - $20,000</td></tr>

                        </table>
                        <p>I price based on what the problem is costing you, not how many hours it takes me. If the math doesn't work, I'll tell you.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do you charge hourly or fixed price?</h3>
                        <p>Fixed price for most projects. You'll know the total cost upfront before we start.</p>
                        <p>I break projects into milestones so you're never paying for work that hasn't been done. Discovery first, then build, then testing and handoff. You approve each phase before we move to the next.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do you offer payment plans?</h3>
                        <p>For larger projects, yes. We can structure milestones in a way that spreads the investment out over the project timeline. Just ask.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What's the minimum project size?</h3>
                        <p>There's no hard minimum, but most projects start around $2,500. Smaller projects can work if they're genuinely quick or if there's potential for an ongoing relationship.</p>
                        <p>If your budget is tight, I'm happy to point you toward resources or simpler solutions that might work for your situation.</p>

                        <h3>How does this work?</h3>
                        <p><strong>1. We talk.</strong> You tell me what's broken. I ask questions. We figure out if I can help.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Discovery.</strong> I get into your systems, confirm the approach works, and map out exactly what needs to happen. This is usually $200-400 and credits toward the full project.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. Build.</strong> I build the thing. You get updates along the way. No surprises.</p>
                        <p><strong>4. Testing and handoff.</strong> We make sure it works. I document everything. You're not dependent on me to understand your own system.</p>
                        <p><strong>5. Support.</strong> I stick around to make sure it's actually working in the real world.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>That's fine. Most people don't.</p>
                        <p>You know something's not working. You know it's costing you time or money or sanity. You just don't know what the fix looks like.</p>
                        <p>That's my job to figure out. The discovery call is free. We'll talk through what's happening and I'll tell you what I think makes sense, even if the answer is "you don't need me."</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Will I understand how it works when you're done?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. Every project includes documentation. Plain English, not technical jargon.</p>
                        <p>I also do a handoff walkthrough so you know how everything works. The goal is for you to not need me for day-to-day stuff. You should be able to make simple changes yourself.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What if something breaks after you're done?</h3>
                        <p>I include a support window after every project (usually 2-4 weeks depending on scope). If something's not working right, I fix it.</p>
                        <p>After that, you can reach out anytime if something comes up. I'm not going to leave you hanging on something I built. For ongoing support, I offer retainer arrangements so you have someone who knows your systems on call.</p>

                        <p>Custom software is building something new, like a dashboard, internal tool, or portal that doesn't exist anywhere else.</p>
                        <p>Most projects are automation. Custom software is for when off-the-shelf tools can't do what you need.</p>

                        <p>But off-the-shelf software is built for everyone, which means it's not built for you specifically. Custom tools are built around how you actually work, not how the software thinks you should work.</p>

                        <p>For the build phase, we work in milestones. You approve each milestone before I start the next one. If we need to part ways, you pay for completed work and keep everything that's been built.</p>
