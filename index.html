                <div class="intro-content">
                    <p>The technical build is the easy part. What you're paying for is someone who takes the time to understand your business, figures out where the bottlenecks actually are, and builds something for where you're going, not just where you are today.</p>

                    <p>I'm a growth partner, not a task executor.</p>

                    <p>Most automation fails within six months. Not because the technology doesn't work, but because someone built fast instead of building right. I spent five years at Wells Fargo building systems where downtime costs six figures per hour. That taught me what separates automation that works from automation that breaks.</p>

                    <p>I start every project by understanding what the problem is costing you. Hours per week, labor costs, missed opportunities. Once we know that number, everything else follows, including exactly when you'll see your investment back.</p>

                    <p>I turn down projects that don't make sense. If fixing your process is smarter than automating a broken one, I'll tell you, even when it costs me revenue. I'm building a business on relationships, not transactions.</p>

                        <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Their team was spending weeks manually analyzing transaction data, trying to figure out what was actually driving profitability. With 200,000+ transactions across 90 days, the manual approach wasn't scaling.</p>

                        <p><strong>What I built:</strong> An AI system that automated the entire analysis pipeline. What used to take weeks now takes hours.</p>

                        <p><strong>The outcome:</strong> Identified a £4 million growth opportunity that led to immediate strategic pivots. The analysis that was bottlenecking their planning now runs whenever they need it.</p>

                        <p><strong>The problem:</strong> This Denver furniture retailer was manually sending 30-40 customer emails a day. Order confirmations, production updates, delivery coordination. Someone had to remember to send the right email at the right time, and things were falling through the cracks.</p>

                        <p><strong>What I built:</strong> A system that monitors Shopify orders and automatically sends the right email based on order status. Handles 9 different scenarios based on product type and delivery partner, prevents duplicates, and logs everything.</p>

                        <p><strong>The outcome:</strong> 15+ hours monthly back in their pocket. Zero missed communications. The system scales with them as they grow, no additional work required.</p>

                        <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Film production company tracking hundreds of equipment items across multiple locations with paper lists and memory. No visibility into what was where, constant texting to track things down, and equipment getting lost between shoots.</p>

                        <p><strong>What I built:</strong> A custom inventory system using Google Sheets with QR code mobile access. Crew members scan equipment in and out from their phones. Real-time sync across all locations.</p>

                        <p><strong>The outcome:</strong> Complete equipment visibility without the manual updates. 20+ hours weekly saved. The system paid for itself in the first month.</p>

                        <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Leading auction house was drowning in manual product listing work. Every item needed photography analysis, descriptions, and posting across multiple platforms. The manual process couldn't keep up with inventory.</p>

                        <p><strong>What I built:</strong> An AI system that handles product photography analysis, generates listing content automatically, and distributes to all sales channels. Processes 50-100 products daily without human intervention.</p>

                        <p><strong>The outcome:</strong> $52K annual savings. 1,040+ hours back annually. The system runs around the clock, processing 3,000 products monthly while the team focuses on sourcing and customer relationships.</p>

                        <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Agency owner was manually logging into Meta and Google Ads every month, pulling spend data for each client, organizing it in spreadsheets, and calculating fees. With a growing client roster, the process was becoming a bottleneck.</p>

                        <p><strong>What I built:</strong> An automated system that pulls spend data from both platforms via API, aggregates by client, calculates fees based on each client's billing structure (flat, percentage, or hybrid with caps), and outputs an invoice-ready report.</p>

                        <p><strong>The outcome:</strong> Monthly reporting now takes 15 minutes instead of 2-4 hours. Runs automatically on the 1st of each month. Adding new clients is just a spreadsheet row. The foundation for automated invoice generation in Phase 2.</p>

                        <h3>Prediction Market Trader (AI Forecasting)</h3>
                        <p class="case-study-headline"><span class="highlight-result">Hundreds of markets analyzed daily</span>, manual research eliminated</p>

                        <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Prediction market trader was manually researching earnings call outcomes for hundreds of markets. Reading analyst reports, checking historical data, making forecasts one at a time. The research bottleneck limited how many opportunities he could evaluate.</p>

                        <p><strong>What I built:</strong> An n8n pipeline that pulls active markets from Kalshi's API, enriches each with company data, sends batches to GPT-4o for probability forecasting, and outputs everything to a Google Sheet with confidence scores and reasoning.</p>

                        <p><strong>The outcome:</strong> What took hours of manual research now runs automatically. Hundreds of markets analyzed daily. The trader focuses on decision-making instead of data gathering.</p>

                        <p class="case-study-headline"><span class="highlight-result">83GB recovered, 43 workflows saved</span>, 2 hours to full operation</p>

                        <p><strong>The problem:</strong> Client's VPS hit 100% disk full. Docker crashed. Their entire n8n automation infrastructure was down, and they couldn't even SSH in to diagnose. Their business operations depended on those workflows running.</p>

                        <p><strong>What I built:</strong> Diagnosed the issue (83GB SQLite database bloat from execution logs), found a creative solution using RAM as temporary backup space (the only space available), extracted all 43 workflows and 16 credentials, reset the database, restored everything, and configured auto-pruning to prevent recurrence.</p>

                        <p><strong>The outcome:</strong> From "everything is down and we can't get in" to fully operational in 2 hours. 83GB recovered (disk went from 100% to 15%). All workflows and credentials preserved. Led to an ongoing development contract.</p>

                <div class="process-intro">
                    <p>I start by understanding what the problem is costing you. Hours per week, labor costs, missed opportunities. That's how we figure out if the investment makes sense and when you'll see ROI.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="services-list">

                        <h3>Step 1: Discovery Call (30 minutes, free)</h3>
                        <p>We talk about what's slowing you down. I ask about your current workflow, where time disappears, and what you've tried. I'll tell you honestly whether automation makes sense for your situation.</p>
                        <p>Some problems need better process, not more automation. If I can't help you, I'll say so and point you in the right direction.</p>

                        <p>If we're a good fit, I send a detailed proposal with clear deliverables, timeline, investment, and ROI calculation. You see exactly what you're getting and when it pays for itself.</p>
                        <p>No vague promises. Specific functionality, specific outcomes, specific milestones.</p>

                        <h3>Step 3: Build (2-6 weeks depending on scope)</h3>
                        <p>Build the system. Test with your team. Deploy when it's ready, not when a deadline says so.</p>
                        <p>This includes training your team, documenting everything, and making sure you can manage it without me if needed.</p>

                        <p>Available if you want it. Not required if you don't. Some clients prefer one-off projects. Others want ongoing optimization as their business evolves.</p>
