                <div class="intro-content">
                    <p><strong>I know this is a long shot, but hear me out.</strong></p>

                    <p>I began partnering with Wells Fargo building systems that process millions of transactions every day. The kind where if something goes wrong, it's a really bad day for a lot of people.</p>

                    <p>That experience taught me how to build things that don't break and how to automate processes so they run on their own.</p>

                    <p>Now I run <a href="https://fortewebdesigns.com" class="inline-link">Forte Web Designs</a>, where I build automation systems for growing businesses.</p>

                    <p>Here's what I noticed. Small and medium-sized businesses are drowning in manual work that could be automated in a weekend. They're spending 10-20 hours every week copying data between systems, sending the same emails over and over, and doing tasks that make them think "there has to be a better way."</p>

                    <p><strong>There is a better way.</strong></p>

                    <p>The same principles that keep bank systems running apply to your business. Build it once, make it reliable, let it run without constant intervention.</p>

                    <p>Here's the deal. I'll build you something small first to prove it works. Usually free or very low cost. If you like it and it makes sense, we keep going. If not, no hard feelings. You got free automation and I got practice.</p>

                    <p class="intro-final">Sound fair?</p>

                <h2 class="section-title-alt">WHY YOU SHOULD BELIEVE ME (OR NOT)</h2>

                <div class="credibility-content">
                    <p>Look, everyone claims they can automate your business. Most are full of hot air.</p>

                    <p>I spent years building systems at a bank where breaking things isn't just bad, it's national news bad. You learn real fast how to build stuff that works and keeps working.</p>

                    <p>I don't automate everything because that would be dumb. I automate the boring repetitive stuff. The tasks you do the exact same way every time. The things that happen so often you could do them in your sleep. The work that doesn't need you making complex decisions.</p>

                    <p>And I don't use fancy AI when you don't need it. Sometimes you need the advanced stuff. Sometimes you just need "when this happens, do that" and boom, you're done.</p>

                    <p><strong>Here's what most people get wrong.</strong> The technical part is easy. I can build automation in my sleep. The hard part is understanding your business well enough to know what to automate and what to leave alone. That's where most consultants fail. They automate the wrong things or automate broken processes.</p>

                    <p>I spend more time understanding how your business actually works than I do writing code. Because if I automate the wrong thing, it doesn't matter how good the automation is.</p>

                    <p>My whole goal is to deliver more value than I cost. If I can't do that, I don't deserve your money. Pretty simple.</p>

                    <p class="credibility-truth">Here's the part nobody else will tell you. Sometimes automation isn't the answer. Sometimes your process is broken and slapping automation on top just makes it break faster. I'll tell you that honestly instead of taking your money.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title-alt">HOW PRICING ACTUALLY WORKS</h2>

                <div class="pricing-content">
                    <p class="pricing-lead">I price based on results, not hours.</p>

                    <p>If the automation doesn't save you time or make you money, you don't pay. I say this with confidence because business growth isn't luck. It's a system.</p>

                    <p>I've built enough of these to know what works and what doesn't. If I can't deliver more value than I cost, I don't deserve to get paid. Pretty straightforward.</p>

                    <p>Here's how we actually start. I build something small first to prove it works. Usually free or very low cost. You see the value before spending real money. If you don't like it or it doesn't work, we're done. No hard feelings.</p>

                    <p>Once you've seen it work, we talk about what else makes sense. Projects run anywhere from $500 to $25,000 depending on complexity. Small wins. Big transformations. Whatever fits.</p>

                    <p><strong>The math is simple.</strong> If automation saves you 10 hours per week, that's $25K to $50K in annual savings. Most projects pay for themselves in 1 to 3 months.</p>

                    <p class="pricing-proof">The CR Deals project saved $52K in the first year. Cost a fraction of that. Still running months later with zero problems.</p>

                    <p class="pricing-standard">That's the standard.</p>

                        <p>Once you've seen it work, we deploy fully and add anything else that makes sense. Usually takes 2 to 6 weeks depending on complexity.</p>

                    <p>Look, I'm not going to hard-sell you. I hate being sold to, so I don't do it to others.</p>

                    <p>Here's the reality. If you're spending hours every week on manual tasks, I can probably help. I've done it for fintech companies, film productions, auction houses, and dozens of other businesses.</p>

                    <p>I'll be honest about whether automation makes sense. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you need to fix your process first. I'll tell you that instead of taking your money.</p>

                    <p><strong>But if it does make sense,</strong> I'll build you something that actually works reliably, pays for itself in 1 to 3 months, doesn't require constant maintenance, and solves a real problem instead of creating new ones.</p>

                    <p>We can start small. Build one thing. Prove it works. Then decide if we keep going.</p>

                        <p>I'm a software engineer turned consultant.</p>

                        <p>I partner with Wells Fargo building systems that process millions of transactions every day. The kind where if something goes wrong, it's a really bad day for a lot of people. That experience taught me how to build things that don't break and how to automate processes so they run on their own.</p>

                        <p>But I kept seeing smaller businesses spending hours on tasks I could automate in a weekend. They didn't need enterprise software. They just needed someone who knew how to connect the dots and make systems reliable.</p>

                        <p>So I started Forte Web Designs as a consultant helping businesses eliminate manual work through automation and custom software.</p>

                        <p>I'm based in Texas. I work with clients nationwide. I probably drink too much coffee. I'm not great at small talk but I'm excellent at solving problems.</p>

                        <p>I also write about what I'm learning and coach business owners on how to run more efficient operations, where to automate, and how to scale without constant headcount increases.</p>

                        <p><strong>My philosophy is pretty simple.</strong> Build things that work. Be honest about limitations. Deliver more value than I cost. Don't overthink it.</p>

                        <p class="about-final">If that sounds like someone you'd want to work with, let's talk.</p>
