                <h2 class="section-title-alt">BACKGROUND</h2>

                <div class="intro-content">
                    <p>Most automation fails within six months. Not because the technology doesn't work, but because it was built fast instead of built right.</p>

                    <p>I spent five years at Wells Fargo building systems that handle millions of transactions daily. The kind where downtime costs six figures per hour and "good enough" isn't acceptable.</p>

                    <p>That environment taught me what separates automation that works from automation that breaks:</p>

                    <p><strong>Architecture matters more than tools.</strong> I've seen simple workflows outlast complex ones because they were designed for scale from day one.</p>

                    <p><strong>Error handling isn't optional.</strong> When something goes wrong at 2 AM, the system should recover itself or tell you exactly what broke and why.</p>

                    <p><strong>Documentation saves relationships.</strong> Six months from now, someone needs to understand how this works. Future you will thank present you.</p>

                    <p>I started Forte Web Designs because I kept seeing businesses drowning in manual work that could be automated in a weekend. They didn't need enterprise software. They just needed someone who knew how to connect the dots and make systems reliable.</p>

                    <p>Most of my clients come from two places: they tried template solutions that didn't fit their business, or they hired someone who built fast and disappeared when it broke.</p>

                    <p>I take on limited projects each month. Not because of artificial scarcity, but because I can't deliver quality while juggling 20 clients. You get direct access to me, not an account manager reading from a script.</p>

                    <p>Most clients start with a single automation project to solve their biggest bottleneck. After seeing measurable results, many transition to ongoing optimization as they discover more opportunities.</p>
                    <p>I'm selective about projects. I only take work where I'm confident I can deliver real ROI. If automation isn't the answer, I'll tell you that upfront and point you in the right direction.</p>

                        <h3>Discovery Call (30 minutes)</h3>
                        <p>We talk about what's slowing you down. I ask questions about your current workflow, where time disappears, and what you've already tried. I tell you honestly whether automation makes sense for your situation.</p>
                        <p>Some problems need better process, not more automation. Some need a different tool entirely. If I can't help you, I'll say so and suggest alternatives.</p>

                        <h3>Proposal & Scope (2-3 days)</h3>
                        <p>If we're a good fit, I send a detailed proposal with clear deliverables, timeline, and investment. You see exactly what you're getting before committing.</p>
                        <p>No vague "we'll build you a system" promises. Specific functionality, specific outcomes, specific milestones.</p>

                        <h3>Proof of Concept (1-2 weeks)</h3>
                        <p>For larger projects, we start with a small prototype. You see what you're getting before the full build. This catches misalignment early when it's cheap to fix.</p>
                        <p>Most clients are surprised by how much a simple prototype reveals about their actual workflow versus how they thought it worked.</p>

                        <h3>Full Implementation (2-6 weeks)</h3>
                        <p>Build the complete system. Test thoroughly with your team. Deploy when it's actually ready, not when a deadline says so.</p>
                        <p>This includes training your team, documenting everything, and making sure you can manage it without me if needed.</p>

                        <p>Available if you want it. Not required if you don't. Some clients prefer one-off projects. Others want continuous optimization as their business evolves. Both work.</p>

                        <p>I'm Seth Forte. I build automation systems for businesses through Forte Web Designs.</p>

                        <p>My approach is simple: I always want to deliver more value than I cost. If I can't do that, I won't take your project.</p>

                        <p>When I'm not building systems, I'm at the gym, gaming, or writing about what I learn. I live in Grapevine, Texas and work with clients nationwide.</p>

                        <p>Most of what I know, I share for free on this site. Some of it you can hire me to build for you.</p>
