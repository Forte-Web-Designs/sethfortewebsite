                <p class="hero-subtext">Now I help businesses automate the work that's slowing them down. Not with templates or shortcuts. With systems built to last.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2 class="section-title-alt">BACKGROUND</h2>

                <div class="intro-content">
                    <p>Most automation fails within six months. Not because the technology doesn't work, but because it was built fast instead of built right.</p>

                    <p>I spent five years at Wells Fargo building systems that handle millions of transactions daily. The kind where downtime costs six figures per hour and "good enough" isn't acceptable.</p>

                    <p>That environment taught me what separates automation that works from automation that breaks:</p>

                    <p><strong>Architecture matters more than tools.</strong> I've seen simple workflows outlast complex ones because they were designed for scale from day one.</p>

                    <p><strong>Error handling isn't optional.</strong> When something goes wrong at 2 AM, the system should recover itself or tell you exactly what broke and why.</p>

                    <p><strong>Documentation saves relationships.</strong> Six months from now, someone needs to understand how this works. Future you will thank present you.</p>

                    <p>I started Forte Web Designs because I kept seeing businesses drowning in manual work that could be automated in a weekend. They didn't need enterprise software. They just needed someone who knew how to connect the dots and make systems reliable.</p>

                    <p>Most of my clients come from two places: they tried template solutions that didn't fit their business, or they hired someone who built fast and disappeared when it broke.</p>

                    <p>I take on limited projects each month. Not because of artificial scarcity, but because I can't deliver quality while juggling 20 clients. You get direct access to me, not an account manager reading from a script.</p>

                            <p>Stop fighting friction in your daily life. Most people tolerate dozens of small annoyances that drain their time and energy. A simple friction audit helps you identify and eliminate them systematically.</p>
                            <p>This framework applies to business processes too: identify friction, quantify impact, eliminate or automate. The same thinking that improves your morning routine scales to operational workflows saving 20+ hours weekly.</p>

                            <p>Like how you'll have imposter syndrome for six months even though you're more qualified than half the people charging twice your rate. How pricing feels impossible at first because you're used to hourly wages, not value-based pricing. How you'll turn down work that sounds lucrative because you know it'll be a nightmare client.</p>
                            <p>The transition from employee to consultant isn't about skills. You already have those. It's about psychology, positioning, and learning when to say no.</p>

                            <p>Here's what actually keeps you valuable when anyone can build the thing: understanding business problems deeply enough to know what to build. Architecting systems that scale. Making tradeoffs between perfect and good enough. Communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.</p>
                            <p>The technical implementation is becoming commodity. The strategic thinking isn't.</p>

                <div class="process-intro">
                    <p>Most clients start with a single automation project to solve their biggest bottleneck. After seeing measurable results, many transition to ongoing optimization as they discover more opportunities.</p>
                    <p>I'm selective about projects. I only take work where I'm confident I can deliver real ROI. If automation isn't the answer, I'll tell you that upfront and point you in the right direction.</p>
                    <p>Here's the typical process:</p>

                        <h3>Discovery Call (30 minutes)</h3>
                        <p>We talk about what's slowing you down. I ask questions about your current workflow, where time disappears, and what you've already tried. I tell you honestly whether automation makes sense for your situation.</p>
                        <p>Some problems need better process, not more automation. Some need a different tool entirely. If I can't help you, I'll say so and suggest alternatives.</p>

                        <h3>Proposal & Scope (2-3 days)</h3>
                        <p>If we're a good fit, I send a detailed proposal with clear deliverables, timeline, and investment. You see exactly what you're getting before committing.</p>
                        <p>No vague "we'll build you a system" promises. Specific functionality, specific outcomes, specific milestones.</p>

                        <h3>Proof of Concept (1-2 weeks)</h3>
                        <p>For larger projects, we start with a small prototype. You see what you're getting before the full build. This catches misalignment early when it's cheap to fix.</p>
                        <p>Most clients are surprised by how much a simple prototype reveals about their actual workflow versus how they thought it worked.</p>

                        <h3>Full Implementation (2-6 weeks)</h3>
                        <p>Build the complete system. Test thoroughly with your team. Deploy when it's actually ready, not when a deadline says so.</p>
                        <p>This includes training your team, documenting everything, and making sure you can manage it without me if needed.</p>

                        <p>Available if you want it. Not required if you don't. Some clients prefer one-off projects. Others want continuous optimization as their business evolves. Both work.</p>

                        <p>I'm Seth Forte. Software engineer at Wells Fargo by day, automation consultant through Forte Web Designs by night.</p>

                        <p>The day job taught me enterprise-grade reliability. The consulting work lets me apply those same standards to businesses that don't have six-figure budgets for custom software.</p>

                        <p>I live in Grapevine with my wife Sophia. When I'm not building systems, we're involved in our neighborhood—organizing community events, working with local law enforcement on safety initiatives, and helping transform our area into a place people want to live.</p>

                        <p>I write about automation, software engineering, and building a consulting business at sethforte.com/writing. Most of it's free. Some of it you can hire me to implement.</p>
